## üîß Integration with Frontend

The GraphQL API is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing static site. You can:

1. **Fetch dynamic content** using GraphQL queries from the frontend JavaScript
2. **Submit forms** using GraphQL mutations instead of traditional form submissions
3. **Display real-time information** like available appointment slots
4. **Show personalized content** based on user interactions

### Example Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Example: Fetch doctor profile in frontend
async function loadDoctorProfile() {
  const response = await fetch('/graphql', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: `
        query GetProfile {
          profile {
            name
            title
            bio
            specializations
          }
        }
      `
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.data.profile;
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production
The GraphQL server can be deployed alongside the static site:
```bash
npm start
```

### Environment Variables
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 4000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)

## üîí CORS Configuration

The API is configured with CORS support for:
- Development: All origins allowed
- Production: Restricted to `thefadil.site` and `dr-fadil-profile.pages.dev`

## üìö Healthcare Data Structure

- **Medical Services** with categories and availability
- **Professional Credentials** including certifications
- **Healthcare Innovations** with technology focus
- **Research Publications** with abstracts and links
- **Contact Information** with clinic hours
- **Appointment Scheduling** with time slot management
