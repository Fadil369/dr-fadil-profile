# Quick Fix for thefadil.site Issue

## Problem
Domain showing "BrainSAIT Email Worker" instead of Dr. Fadil profile

## Most Likely Cause
A Cloudflare Worker named "BrainSAIT Email Worker" has a route configured for `thefadil.site/*`

## Immediate Solutions (in order of preference):

### Option 1: Remove Worker Route
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Workers & Pages
2. Find "BrainSAIT Email Worker"
3. Go to Routes tab
4. Delete any route matching `thefladil.site/*`

### Option 2: Modify Worker Route
1. Change worker route from `thefadil.site/*` to `thefadil.site/api/*`
2. This allows the worker to handle API calls but lets Pages handle the root

### Option 3: Use Subdomain
1. In Pages project, add custom domain: `www.thefadil.site`
2. Update DNS to point `www` CNAME to Pages project
3. Add redirect from root to www

### Option 4: Worker Route Priority
1. Ensure Pages custom domain is added FIRST
2. Then add worker routes with specific paths only

## Verification Commands:
```bash
# Test after changes
curl -I https://thefadil.site
dig thefadil.site
nslookup thefadil.site
```

## Expected Result:
Should see Dr. Fadil profile page instead of Email Worker message
